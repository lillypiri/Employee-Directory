#### Project 5 📒🎓

## Employee Directory

###### This is the second of twelve projects for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.


I've aimed for Exceeds Expectations by expanding the project as follows:

- Employees can be filtered by name or username
- Functionality has been added to switch back and forth between employees when the detail modal window is open.
- Tested on Chrome (Version 61.0.3163.91 (Official Build) (64-bit)), Firefox (55.0.3 (64-bit), & Safari (Version 10.1.2 (12603.3.8)).
